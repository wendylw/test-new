## Developing components in Isolation

If you are a component developer, read this section.

We added `storybook` in project, no need configuring project, just run story book.

```shell script
yarn storybook
``` 

> browser will automatically start on port `9009`

## Get started

<a name="pre-install-stuffs"></a>
### Pre install stuffs

1. Install `nvm` with Homebrew

    $ `brew install nvm`

2. Install `node` with NVM

    $ `nvm install v8.17.0`

3. Install `yarn` with Homebrew

    $ `brew install yarn`

<a name="quick-start"></a>
### Quick start

1. Init projects

    install dependency

    ```bash
    nvm use v8.17.0
    
    (cd ./frontend; yarn install)
   
    (cd ./backend; git submodule update --init && yarn install)
    ```
   
    > PS, once you change the domain, you need to update
    > 1. `"proxy": "http://nike.storehub.net:7000",` in `./frontend/package.json` file
    > 2. `HOST=nike.storehub.net` in `./frontend/.env` file, if you connect backend
    > 3. restart frontend

2. Init env files

    $ `(cd ./frontend; cp .env.example .env)`
    
    $ `(cd ./backend; cp .env.example .env)`

3. Init backend static folder from frontend

    $ `(cd ./frontend; yarn build)`
    
    build frontend will automatically trigger copy `./frontend/build` to `./backend/client/build`. 
    So backend will use it as static folder to load `index.html` file in it for browsering urls directly.
    
    if you want page to load **static** files from another domain, just set env `PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` file, 
    Eg. `PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:7070`, means page will load all **static** files from it.
    
    if you want page to call api to **bff** when in development, set up `proxy` in `package.json`, 
    Eg. `"proxy": "http://localhost:7000`, means dev server proxies requests to the **bff**.

<a name="quick-start-mockdata-mode"></a>
#### when use local mockdata as backend

1. Init local domain

    add `127.0.0.1 nike.storehub.net` into `/etc/hosts` file.

    
2. Start mock mode backend and assets server

    start backend in mock api mode:

    $ `(cd ./backend; yarn mockstart)`
    
    start assets server making a show of cdn ðŸ˜Š

    $ `(cd ./backend; yarn publicstart)`
    
    then browse http://nike.storehub.net:7000/ to see result, and this triggers to make cookies ready for frontend dev server as well.

3. Start frontend dev server

    $ `(cd ./frontend; yarn start)`

    then browse http://nike.storehub.net:3000/ to see result

<a name="quick-start-uat-integration-mode"></a>
#### when use UAT as backend

1. Setup to use production back-end. Let's say to use https://ck.beep.test12.shub.us of production as api server. 

    Fill in  `127.0.0.1 ck.local.beep.test12.shub.us` in `/etc/hosts` file
    
    Fill in `HOST=ck.local.beep.test12.shub.us` in `./frontend/.env` file,
    so that dev server bypass domain from frontend to backend.

    Fill in `"proxy": "https://ck.beep.test12.shub.us",` in `./frontend/package.json` file

2. Start up dev

    $ `yarn start`
    
    Browser will open for you.

3. Adjust cookie

    Browse origin site which is behind proxy https://ck.beep.test12.shub.us,
    and edit `domain` of cookies make them `.beep.test12.shub.us` 
    to share with the domain of dev server.
    
4. See result

    Browse dev server site http://ck.local.beep.test12.shub.us

```text
REACT_APP_MERCHANT_STORE_URL=https://%business%.beep.test15.shub.us
REACT_APP_QR_SCAN_DOMAINS=localhost,beepit.com,www.beepit.com
